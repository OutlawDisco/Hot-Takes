  ## Description
  An interactive movie-review site for the hot takes of real movie goers, not critics!

  ## Usage
  In a web browser, go to https://hot-takes-reviews-b29812e3e846.herokuapp.com/ to sarch movies, user ratings and reviews. Sign up or login to add your own "hot takes" on your favorite movies or interact with other user reviews. Add a "heat up" vote on reviews you think are great or a "cool down" vote for reviews you don't care for.

  ## User Story
  As a casual movie viewer I would like an application to visit where peer reviews will be available for movies I've seen. When I load the application I will be prompted with a landing page that has a search bar functionality and a review section. Within a navbar will be a sign in feature for users to sign into their account. Upon logging in a table of past reviews will appear. Upon searching for a new movie a list of top rated reviews will appear along with a text area where a new review can be added. Upon submission of your review other users will have the ability to upvote or downvote your review. By adding the feature of upvote/downvote users will be able to better gauge if a movie will be within their liking.
