  ## Description
  A movie website for the hot takes of real movie goers, not reviewers!

  ## Usage
  In a web browser, browse to https://hot-takes-reviews-b29812e3e846.herokuapp.com/ sign up then login and review movies, see others reviews and up or down vote reviews of movies. If you dont want to sign up, you can see movies and reviews.

  ## Installation
  NA

  ## User Story
  As a casual movie viewer I would like an application to visit where peer reviews will be available for movies. When I load the application I will be prompted with a landing page that has a search bar functionality and a review section. Within a navbar will be a sign in feature for users to sign into their account. Upon logging in a table of past reviews will appear. Upon searching for a new movie a list of top rated reviews will appear along with a text area where a new review can be added. Upon submission of your review other users will have the ability to upvote or downvote your review. By adding the feature of upvote/downvote users will be able to better gauge if a movie will be within their liking.
